AI-Driven Pipeline for Deep-Sea Biodiversity DiscoveryProject ID: ID25042Prepared for: Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE)1. IntroductionThis project provides an end-to-end, AI-driven pipeline to discover and analyze deep-sea biodiversity from environmental DNA (eDNA) datasets. The system translates raw DNA sequencing files into a fully interactive web-based dashboard, enabling researchers to explore taxonomic compositions, identify potentially novel lineages, and visualize complex ecological data.The core of this pipeline uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for taxa-agnostic clustering of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), allowing for the discovery of microbial groups without prior taxonomic knowledge.2. The Pipeline WorkflowThe project is divided into two main parts: a core data processing pipeline and an interactive discovery dashboard.Part 1: Core Data Processing & AI AnalysisSequence Pre-processing & ASV Generation: Raw FASTQ files are trimmed, filtered, and processed using DADA2 to generate high-fidelity Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs).Unsupervised Deep Learning: A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) implemented in PyTorch/TensorFlow converts ASV sequences into numerical vectors. These vectors are then clustered using HDBSCAN to group similar ASVs into "putative taxa."Hybrid Annotation & Phylogenetics: Clusters are annotated using BLAST+. Clusters that fall below a certain identity threshold are flagged as "Potentially Novel Lineages" and placed onto a reference phylogenetic tree using EPA-ng to determine their evolutionary context.Abundance Estimation: The relative abundance of each final annotated taxon is calculated across all samples, creating a master data matrix for visualization.Part 2: Interactive DashboardBackend API: A robust Java / Spring Boot RESTful API serves the processed data from a PostgreSQL database.Frontend Application: A responsive user interface built with React (or Vue.js) and D3.js allows for intuitive data exploration through interactive heatmaps, charts, and a dynamic phylogenetic tree viewer.3.
